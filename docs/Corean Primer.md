### INTRODUCTION.
T<small>HE</small> following lessons are intended to introduce to the Corean language those desirous to prepare for the official, mercantile, and chiefly the missionary intercourse with Corea, which cannot be of distant date. The Corean words are given in the Corean alphabet in syllables, under which is the Corean pronunciation in Roman letters, and the interpretation in English, according to the Corean idiom, viz. nom. obj., verb, negative.

The lessons, matter, arrangement and number., are those of my “Mandarin Primer,” where the English is rendered idiomatically. The transliteration is also on the principle of that Primer. And in comparing the two little books it will be discovered what a remarkable proportion of Chinese words has become incorporated with the Corean language, supplying defects, displacing some words and used alongside of others, (as *bit*, “light” and *gwang* “light,” metaphorically), like Latin and Saxon in English, Chinese being the Latin of the Coreans, through which their learning has been acquired. This comparison requires only to note the defects of the Corean alphabet and its numerous terminative particles. The “Corean Primer” also affords numerous examples of the ancient pronunciation of Chinese, and especially of the final consonant dropped in Mandarin, though retained in the south.

As it is reported that a practised pen is engaged on, or has finished, a Corean Grammar, it is unnecessary to explain the use of the numerous and delicate particles. But as the Corean language, with no case for

its nouns or persons for its verbs, has the remarkable quality of inflexion according to the rank of the person addressed,—superior, equal, or inferior,—it is deemed advisable to give the pronouns and a verb, in its various tenses, with the proper terminations affixed.

안 and 못 are both negatives but differently used, as will be frequently seen in the lesson; 캇 is the 갓 of the affirmative–future. The 2, or middle form is that in constant use, though respect to age, places parents and much older people among the 1 class; while 3 comprises children as well as underlings.

The verb to “eat” follows, in the middle or commonly used form; *gut*, material(never used alone); *mugghulgut*, eatables.

| Eat (imp.) | *muggushi*. |
| Have you eaten? | *mughussumma upsumma*? |
| Have eaten | *mughussum*. |
| Have not eaten | *mughumi upsowê*. |
| Will you eat? | *muggatdadun mugdi ankatdadun*? |
| Will not eat. | *mugdi ansupdê*. |
| Cannot eat. | *mugdi mot-hummuni*. |
| Unwilling to eat. | *mugdi ankatdapdê*. |
| I will eat. | *mogassummê*. |
| He will eat | *moghatdapdê*. |

The changes demanded by euphony belong to grammar but one or

two examples may be given as guides to the etymology of the words in the lessons.

* Root of “come” is 오, *o*, 1 *o-oo*; 2 *oshi* 3 not *ora*, but *ona*.
* To “work” is “to do labour”; labour is 일 *il*, “to do,” root 하 *ha*. 2 is *ir hashi*, but 3 is not *ilhara*, but *ilhayura*.

#### T<small>HE</small> A<small>LPHABET</small>.
The alphabet which begins the lessons, is spelled as the Coreans learn it, the Roman letter-spelling being based on the absolute rule of “No one sound to any two letters, no letter with any two sound,”—*e*, *ê* being exceptions, as also k, p, t, (Note 2nd below). Hence each letter should be always pronounced with the same value. Occasionally *u* approaches French *ü*; but not sufficiently near enough to warrant a separate form.

Note 1: The same Corean letter stands for *ds* and *j*; for *ch* and *ts*; for *l* and *r*. Chinese *l* is translated by *n* not by *r*; and *f* by *b* or *p*

Our *w* is formed by prefixing (오) to the vowel; *a* and *i* combine to form *e*, and *u* and *i* to ê.

2. When closing a syllable, *p*, *k*, *t*(ㅂㄱㅅ) are to be pronounced precisely as in English, they holding an intermediate position between *d*, *t*, &c. which are harder than in English, having the same breathing as the Chinese; and d, t, like the Chinese, are pronounced with the tip of the tongue from the edge of the upper row of teeth, instead of from the roof of the mouth.
3. In pronouncing *lip* the Chinaman must take two syllables *li-pu*; The English speaker opening his lips after forming *p*, but uttering no audible sound. The Corean *keeps his lips closed on every final consonant*, permitting no breath to escape, neither vocal like the Chinese, nor inaudible like the English speaker. This renders some finals indistinct as is the case of the final English *k*, *p*, *t* of N. 2.
4. Euphony plays strange tricks with these finals, especially with ㅅ which should be *s*, but is so only before an *s*. It is assimilated by the succeeding consonant, becoming English *t*, before *d* or *t*; *k* before *g*, *k*; *n* before *n*, &c. ㅂ final becomes *m* before *n*, and *v* before *i*. ㄱ very rarely becomes *ng*. ㄴ after ㄹ as *l*, becomes *l*; and ㄹ as *r* after *n*, becomes *n*.
5. When ㅅ precedes a consonant (ᄯᅩ, *dó*) it makes it very acute, like Chinese 4th tone: *h* after *g*, in the same syllable, softens *g* as it does *t* in “*the*,” “*thing*,” &c; as in Hebrew, Gaelic, Irish. But *ogat* is as readily understood as *oghat*
6. The sign O in Corean before the vowel index, serves to distinguish the affix, of which it forms part, from the root which immediately precedes it; e. g. 가르도 and 갈으도 are simmilarly pronounced but the latter points out the root 갈, which the former cannot. It its also

useful in pronouncing the Roman letter, for *hanga* may be pronounced *han-ga* or *hangaa*, the Corean of which is respectively 한가 & 항아.
7. The Corean alphabet, though always in syllables, is written, not from left to right as here, but from top to bottom and right to left, like Chinese; and the current hand in English is no more unlike the printed letter than in the Corean.

There is a slight difference between the pronunciation of this Primer and that of the capital in some words, as *hanul* “heaven,” capital *hanal*; tiundi “heaven and earth,” capital “*chiunji*.” But these are not numerous, and the pronunciation of the west provinces is understood all over Corea.
